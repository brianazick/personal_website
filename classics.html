        <h1> Classics </h1>

        <div class="classics_intro">
            <p> I've studied Classics, i.e. Latin and Ancient Greek, for over ten years between high school and college
                In terms of scholarly pursuits, I wrote <i>Servandae Litterae Antiquae</i> on the extent of the impact
                Byzantine Scholars had on the legacy of modern Greek and Latin literature, a copy of which can be found
                <a href="Content/Servandae Antiquae Litterae.pdf">here.</a></p>

            <p> Over that decade plus, I have engaged with original a text a number of times working in the capacity of
                both translator and performer. Two of my favorite works are by the neoteric poet Catullus and are
                showing below accompanied by English translations, at least partially, of my own hand. </p>

            <p> As a performer, I've memorized and recited many of the same works as school boys from centuries ago
                including Virgils Aeneid and Homer's Illiad. The latter is especially memorable as in any circle devoid
                of classists, the audience simply thinks you are reciting a demonic encantation. </p>

            <p>
                Perhaps the final product of my organized study of the Classics is a the original Latin compisition
                attempting to describe another one of my loves, Rugby, in the language of the Romans. Take a look <a

                and judge it for yourself.</p>

                    I have arrived at these wretched funeral rites for thee <br>

                <p>Sing, O goddess, the anger [mênis] of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the
                    Achaeans. Many a brave soul [psukhê] did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it
                    yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so was the will of Zeus fulfilled from the day on which the
                    son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another. And which of the
                    gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was the son of Zeus and Leto; for he was angry with the
                    king and sent a pestilence upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had
                    dishonored Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to free his
                    daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in his hand the scepter of
                    Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons
                    of Atreus, who were their chiefs. "Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods
                    who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach your homes in safety; but
                    free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her, in reverence to Apollo, son of Zeus."</p>
