    <h1> Brian Zick's Personal Website </h1>
    <p> Hey there! Thanks for landing on my website. This is still a work in progress, but should be coming into its own soon. </p>

    <p> In the meantime, enjoy two of my favorite poems Catullus 85 and 101: </p>

        <p> Catullus 85 (Translation by high school classmates and I) (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0006%3Apoem%3D85" title="Catullus 85" target="_blank">Perseus</a>)</p>
        <blockquote> Odi et amo. Quare id faciam, fortasse requiris <br>
        nescio, sed fieri sentio et excruiior. </blockquote>

        <blockquote> I hate and I love. For what reason I do it, perhaps you ask? <br> 
        I do not know, but I feel that [it] is done and I am tormented. </blockquote>

      <div class="column">
        <p> Catullus 101 (Translation by a college friend and I) (<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0006%3Apoem%3D101" title="Catullus 101" target="_blank">Perseus</a>)</p>
        <blockquote> Multas per gentes et multa per aequora vectus <br>
        advenio has miseras, frater, ad inferias, <br>
        ut te postremo donarem munere mortis <br>
        et mutam nequiquam adloquerer cinerem, <br>
        quandoquidem fortuna mihi tete abstulit ipsum, <br>
        heu miser indigne frater adempte mihi. <br>
        nunc tamen interea haec, prisco quae more parentum <br>
        tradita sunt tristi munere ad inferias, <br>
        accipe fraterno multum manantia fletu <br>
        atque in perpetuum, frater, ave atque vale. </blockquote>

        <blockquote> Brother, through many people and across many seas, <br>
        I have arrived at these wretched funeral rites for thee <br>
        So that I might honor you with the final gift which the dead receive <br>
        And in vain I might address your silent ash. <br>
        Since indeed fate stole you from me <br>
        Alas, poor brother stolen from me prematurely <br>
        But even so, accept these words which I am giving up in the ancient way <br>
        As a sorrowful gift for the funeral rites <br>
        Which are wet with familial tears <br>
        And so forever, hail and farewell, brother. </blockquote>
